    <h1>Computer Science Investigation</h1>
    <div class="format">
    <p class="text">As a part of my investigation, I have looked at several systems for which to base my model upon. Out of the systems I looked at, 3 stood out to me. The first system I looked at was a website/application called Headspace. (“Meditation and Sleep Made Simple - Headspace”) This system is used to help people have a healthy sleep schedule as well as improving their mental wellbeing. The second system I looked at is known as Happify, uses the science behind mental wellbeing in order to reduce stress and anxiety, whilst tracking the user’s progress along the way. (Happify) The final system I looked at is titled RescueTime, which is a system used to limit the user’s screentime, keep an organized schedule of their day, and allows the user to block sites that distract them the most. (“RescueTime: Fully Automated Time Tracking Software”) </p>

    <p class="text">From all these systems, I have incorporated several aspects of them into my own system, which is designed to limit screentime and measure the effect it has on your mental wellbeing as well as monitoring what activities you get up to with the free time you have from the lack of screentime. I am designing this system to be targeted at people who are suffering from spending too much time on their devices, and to help them learn to limit screentime, so as they have more time in their day to partake in other activities which they may deem as more important. In other words, the aim is to decrease procrastination.</p>
        
    <p class="text">With my model, I aim to achieve: </p>
        <ul class="text">
            <li >I wish to use a button that sends a signal to turn this on/off as a digital input/output, and I also wish to use the amount of screentime a user uses as an analogue input. Using this data, I wish to output the amount of screentime as a line graph for an analogue output.</li>
            <li>I wish to gather and store it in firebase.</li>
            <li>I wish to use this information to deliver feedback that is relevant to the user on how they can improve their mental health.</li>
        </ul>   
    <p class="text">The what if questions that I will be looking at include what the effect of using my system will have on the user's mental health, and I wish to also use data from a case study to compare what screentime is considered healthy for a person given their age and recommend activities based on their screentime, their age, and the amount of free time which they have.  </p>
    <p>During my investigation, I conducted a survey on how people think that they are affected by excess amounts of screentime, and the results told me that there was a need for a reduction in people's screentime.</p>
